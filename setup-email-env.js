/**
 * This script provides a template for setting up your email environment variables
 * You will need to create a .env.local file with the following variables:
 * 
 * EMAIL_USER - Your Gmail address
 * EMAIL_PASS - Your Gmail app password (not your regular password)
 * EMAIL_RECIPIENT - Email address where form submissions should be sent
 * 
 * HOW TO USE:
 * 1. Create a .env.local file in the project root
 * 2. Add the following lines (replace with your actual info):
 *    EMAIL_USER=your.email@gmail.com
 *    EMAIL_PASS=your-gmail-app-password
 *    EMAIL_RECIPIENT=your.business@example.com
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: To use Gmail for sending emails, you'll need to:
 * - Enable 2-Step Verification on your Google account
 * - Create an App Password: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
 * - Use that App Password instead of your regular Gmail password
